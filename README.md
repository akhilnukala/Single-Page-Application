# Single-Page-Application

Built a single page front end course directory using 

react.js and JSX to create all the necessary app components and 

react-router router to dynamically render components based on user navigation without reloading the page.

This app lets you navigate between routes through links, render nested routes, keeps track of browser history and even build routes that accept dynamic parameters.
